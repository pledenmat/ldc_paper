# Analysis code supporting the paper entitled "A low-dimensional approximation of optimal confidence"

Beyond traditional R packages, the codes here use functions implemented in a custom package names "myPackage" (the name shall change shortly).
To install it, run the following command in R : 
devtools::install_github("pledenmat/myPackage")

Analyses are divided in 3 scripts in the /scripts folder :
- pcor_fit.R contains simulations results
- exp1_analysis.R contains everything related to Experiment 1
- exp2_analysis.R contains everything related to Experiment 2

For any question or help regarding the code, please send an email to pierre.ledenmat@kuleuven.be
